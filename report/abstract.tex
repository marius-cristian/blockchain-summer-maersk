\section{Abstract}
This paper will explore three solutions for the problem of storing and keeping financial data synchronised across the subsidiaries of a large company, with the possibility of granting an outside entity limited access to it such that the validity of the data can be agreed on.\\
The next chapters present an instance of the problem, a solution from a centralised perspective, a distributed ledger perspective, and a blockchain perspective, with regard to the advantages and disatvantages of each particular case.
