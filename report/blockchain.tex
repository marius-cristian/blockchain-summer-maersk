\section{Adding a Blockchain}
On top of the DLT solution, to add extra transparency and prove that there are no hidden transactions kept from an authority, a public blockchain (it might also be private, but a public one is harder to forge) can be used to store the signatures of the last state of each transaction. This blockchain would be used between super nodes and regulator nodes, such that a super nodes that share a network have to publish (on a time interval, for example once every 24 hours) a summary of the transactions (signatures) latest state, and the tax authority must claim that they have been reported in. The unclaimed transactions in the blockchain can be traced back to the specific subnetwork, and assigned to the specific authority (using a refference) by the Permission node or a smart contract on the blockchain.\\
This fine tune would prevent any claims based on distrust from tax authority part. The cost of this feature should be feasible when dealing with large volmes of data, as we only store hash signatures. Let's assume that a hash signature is 32 bytes (256 bits), according to the Ethereum Yellow Paper\cite{yellow} for storing a 256 bit word, the price is 20000 gas. In 1KB of data, we can fit 31.25 bytes, thus 31.25 transaction hashes let's assume in a 24 hour interval there are 1 million transactions. Therefore in order to store 1 milion signatures, we require 32000KB (32MB) with a subsequent gas price of $2*10^{10}$ gas. According to the gas price oracle\cite{gas} the gas is set by the miners and it fluctuates, but by the latest statistics\cite{ethgas} 1 gas is currently at 4 gwei ($4*10^9$ wei) average. 1 eth is $10^{18}$ wei\cite{yellow} thus: The price of storing 1 milion transactions currently is: $2^3*10^{19}$wei or $80$eth. For the current price of ethereum of 384\$\cite{eth}; 1 million transaction signatures stored on the ethereum blockchain cost 30720\$.
